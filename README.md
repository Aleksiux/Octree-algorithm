TASK Octree algorithm

This repository documents my learning journey about Octrees, matplotlib.pyplot, and the LAS file format. 
I explored the concept of Octrees, their applications, and included code samples for visualization. Additionally, I gained insights into matplotlib.pyplot for data visualization and learned about the LAS file format.

I used these resources to learn:
